This is the beginning of a new website. 

## Huh?
This site is being created for a class, **STA 9750, Software Tools for Data analysis** at [Baruch College | Zicklin School of Business](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/).

## About Me
Jesse Nover here. I am a graduate student pursuing an MS in Business Analytics with a concentration in Data Analytics. I have worked for many years as a UX Designer and you can see some of my work [here](https://jessenover.myportfolio.com/).

## Baruch, what's that?
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

if(!require("leaflet")){
    options(repos=c(CRAN="https://cloud.r-project.org"))
    install.packages("leaflet")
    stopifnot(require("leaflet"))
}

baruch_longitude <- -73.98299
baruch_latitude  <- +40.74033


leaflet() |>
  addTiles() |>
  setView(baruch_longitude, baruch_latitude, zoom=17) |>
  addPopups(baruch_longitude, baruch_latitude, 
            "<b>Baruch College</b> is in the middle of Manhattan. Who knew.")
